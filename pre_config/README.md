# pre_config

## Overview

`pre_config` is the pre-configuration of the project, which is automatically applied to the project after completing the `./configure`.You can save multiple copies of `pre_config` and switch between them when needed.

If you did not select `pre_config` during `./configure` process, the default configuration of kconfig will be used. You can modify the configuration at any time by executing `make menuconfig` in the `./build/` directory.
